Demonstration showcasing the newest SRTE building block: Segment Routing IGP Flexible Algorithms. In this demo, SR Flex Algorithms are used to create delay-optimized network slices created according to measured per-link delay using MPLS performance management. Lastly, viewer will experience how the solution can leverage SR on-demand next hop (ODN) and Automated Steering for intent-based instantiation of traffic engineered paths. In this video Jose Liste demonstrates it.
