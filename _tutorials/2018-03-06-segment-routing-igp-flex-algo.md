title: SR IGP Flexible Algorithm
excerpt: >-
  Flexible Algorithm enriches the SR TE solution by adding additional segments having different properties than the IGP Prefix segments. Flex Algo adds flexible, user-defined segments to the SRTE toolbox. Flex Alg leverages SR on-demand next hop (ODN) and Automated Steering for intent-based instantiation of traffic engineered paths.
